# Trilateration-Trilateration

This code is an adaptation of the example code from https://www.101computing.net/cell-phone-trilateration-algorithm/ 

As is with this code, you have to input a number of beacons between 3 and 9. If fewer than 3 you will get an error message. Otherwise there will be prompts to ender the distances between the beacons and device. 

This is then used to calculate the coordinate point and then angle to turn to the destination point.
